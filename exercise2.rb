#1. I want to leave a decent tip. Multiply ($)55 by 15% or 0.15, the result is your tip amount#
  puts 55 * 0.15

#2. I want to print an integer to a string #
puts "5" + 5.to_s

#I want to output the result of 45628 multiplied by 7839 in a sentence#
puts "Wouldn't it be cool if I added 45628 + 7839 and the answer was #{45628 + 7839} ? I think that would be great personally."

# && = and, so... (if 10 is less than 20 | and | 30 is less than 20[its not]) OR 10 does not equal 11. Side L is false, or side 2 is true. Thus the answer must be True.#
(10 < 20 && 30 < 20) || !(10 == 11)
